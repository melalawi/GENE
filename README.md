# GENE

## Purpose

Googling a gene every few minutes just to get a basic summary gets old, doesn't it? This extension alleviates that annoyance by allowing for convenient, in-text referencing of gene symbols. All you have to do is highlight a human gene symbol. The extension will then query UniProtKB and pull basic information such as the full gene name and protein function are pulled and displayed in a small blurb above the highlighted gene symbol within about a second. Only reviewed genes are included for now.

## Future Additions

-User-defined fields for display. UniProt often includes much more information than simply the full name and protein function for a given gene. We hope to allow users to select what information they'd like to see soon.

-May try to expand to other organisms (mouse, yeast, worms, etc) if it seems the demand is there. Done for chrome, in-progress for firefox version.

-Suggestions for additional features welcome.
